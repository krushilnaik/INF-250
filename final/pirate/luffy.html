        Monkey D. Luffy is the founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates.
        He's from the Foosha Village located in the East Blue. Reckless and
        hopeless in most topics, he relies on his crew members to help him
        fulfill his dream of becoming the Pirate King. To do so, he set sail to
        find the legendary treasure "One Piece", which belonged to the previous
        Pirate King, Gold Roger, before being executed. The treasure is stashed
        away in the most dangerous part of the world, the Grand Line.
        <br />
        <br />
        Luffy ate the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit which made him basically Elastigirl.
