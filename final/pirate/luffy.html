        Monkey D. Luffy is the founder and captain of the Straw Hat pirates. As
        a captain he's pretty reckless and hopeless in most topics so he relies
        on his crew members to help him fulfill his dream which to become the
        Pirate King, dream he&apos;ll fulfill by finding the legendary treasure
        known as the "One Piece", which belonged to the previous Pirate King Gol
        D. Roger. He's from the Foosha Village located in the East Blue.
        <br />
        Luffy ate the Gum Gum devil fruit which made him a rubber human giving
        him rubber like powers.
